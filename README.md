# Hi, I'm Guillem 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — a space where I’m learning, experimenting, and growing in the world of **data science**.  
My background in **physics** and **complex systems** shaped the way I see patterns and connections, and now I’m exploring how data can uncover meaningful stories and create real value — just in a new language: **data**.

### 🧭 A bit about me

Right now, I’m focusing on:
- Getting comfortable with the vast universe of **Data Science**  
- Exploring **Deep Learning** and how it can reveal hidden stories in data  
- Building projects to enhance my portfolio and share what I learn
